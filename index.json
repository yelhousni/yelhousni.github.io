Like the DARPA Grand Challenge, select teams will compete for monetary prizes spanning a range of categories. Over $7M in prize money has been committed, along with token grants from sponsoring projects.\nAll winning submissions will become open-source libraries for the benefit of all. We hope this foundation can support the next generation of decentralized protocols and applications to enable secure, interoperable, and scalable applications for the next-generation web.\n With Gautam Botrel from ConsenSys, we participated in the inaugural edition of ZPrize (2022) in the open division: \u0026ldquo;ACCELERATING MSM ON MOBILE\u0026rdquo; as the gnark team. Our submission resulted in a 4.2x speedup over the baseline and won the first place. The prize was $259,147.\nACCELERATING MSM ON MOBILE  Proving on mobile devices is a transformative technology for applications including private transactions, self-sovereign identity, and scalable computation. Multi-scalar multiplication (MSM) is a core operation for producing zkSNARKs, and it is the primary bottleneck and barrier for deployment of proving on mobile. This prize will focus on minimizing latency of computing MSM in native mobile applications.\n The goal was to write the fastest MSM over BLS12-377 curve on a mobile device (Samsung Galaxy A13 5G). The specification details can be found here.\nOur submission was written in Go, and derived from the gnark-crypto project. On the target device, for a random BLS12-377 G1 MSM ($n = 2^{16}$), we measured:\n ~2309ms for the reference benchmark ~509ms for our submission  This is a -77.9% optimisation.\nCode and techniques The code can be found on github here under Apache-2 or MIT license.\nWe experimented several approaches; here is a description of the key findings for the final ones:\n It uses our in-house gnark-crypto/bls12377 package, which out of the box performs very well compared to the zprize baseline. The MSM algorithm is described in this paper (to appear in TCHES, Issue 3) and the Go code is documented. We introduced a bls12-377 algorithmic optimization; the \u0026ldquo;bucket/pippenger\u0026rdquo; method now uses an optimized twisted edwards extended cordinate system, resulting in a significant performance improvement (~30% on some target). We perform a static build targetting a 64bit arm linux architecture, which allows without a complicated build procress to run 64bit code on the target device. We copy the output in the armv7 (32bit) destination folder; in a production deployment, Java calling code must at runtime check for the actual CPU architecture and switch to a fallback if it\u0026rsquo;s 32bit (outside of the scope of the challenge). Note that while the submission spawn a process at each msm call, other ways may turn out more efficient (allocate the verifying key on the stack, communicate with the process with unix sockets, \u0026hellip;). We hand tuned the field arithmetic for the Multiplication targetting the arm64 architecture. Our pure-go version performed better than the arm assembly one, and resulted in a ~20% speed up on some platforms compared to existing version in gnark-crypto. We implemented and optimized a dedicated Squaring algorithm (rather than calling the Multiplication as in gnark-crypto) following our previous work https://hackmd.io/@gnark/modular_multiplication (also described in the TCHES paper), which resulted in significant perf improvement on the target device. This is not used in the twisted edwards extended MSM, only in the parameterized Jacobian version which uses Affine points as input (branch: buckets/jacobian, performance: ~600ms for $2^16$). For the target (arm64) we add ~40lines of arm assembly for a small function (fp.Butterfly(a, b) -\u0026gt; a = a + b; b = a - b). The perf impact is ~5%, as it speeds up a bit the UnifiedMixedAdd point addition in the buckets (msm). The rest of the submission is compiled from pure Go code; On this device, our GPU experimentations were not promising. We raised an issue to the Golang team. Once the fix is merged into the latest Golang compiler release, we might squeeze an extra 5-10% perf improvement.  Results The results were annouced on 04-04-2023 in this blog post.

In the class of non-interactive proof systems, a particularly interesting concept for proving the computational integrity is the Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (SNARK). It provides a computationally sound proof, cheap to verify and small compared to the size of the statement or the witness. Bilinear pairings over elliptic curves have become key ingredients for instantiating such SNARKs. In this thesis we investigate tailored pairing-friendly elliptic curves to efficiently implement SNARKs. We present a study at three stages of the process: curves to instantiate a SNARK, curves to instantiate a recursive SNARK, and also curves to express an elliptic-curve related statement. We provide new constructions of curves for SNARKs and new families of 2-chain curves for recursive SNARKs. We derive and implement in open-source efficient algorithms to speed up the arithmetic on these curves: Co-factor clearing, subgroup membership testing, multi-scalar multiplication and pairings over 2-chains.

When the curve is not of prime order, the point is multiplied by the cofactor so that the result has a prime order. This is important to avoid small subgroup attacks for example. A second important operation, in the composite-order case, is testing whether a point belongs to the subgroup of prime order. A pairing is a bilinear map e: G1×G2 → GT where G1 and G2 are distinct subgroups of prime order r of an elliptic curve, and GT is a multiplicative subgroup of the same prime order r of a finite field extension. Pairing-friendly curves are rarely of prime order. In this talk, we investigate cofactor clearing and subgroup membership testing on these composite-order curves. First, we generalize a result on faster cofactor clearing for BLS curves to other pairingfriendly families of a polynomial form from the taxonomy of Freeman, Scott and Teske. Second, we investigate subgroup membership testing for G1 and G2. We fix a proof argument for the G2 case that appeared in a preprint by Scott in late 2021 and has recently been implemented in different cryptographic libraries. We then generalize the result to both G1 and G2 and apply it to different pairing-friendly families of curves.

In a fraction of a second, the Universe grew from smaller than a single atom to bigger than a galaxy. And it kept on growing at a fantastic rate. It is still expanding today.\nA biodiversity of species came to life. The total number of all species living on Earth estimates there are about 8.7 million species but the most important specie of all is one that, in the geological time scale, appeared recently. It is the human specie. So much happened on Earth before we came to call it home, but if we only focus on human life there is too much to narrate about.\nOne of the main discoveries by humans was fire control, it was an important step in their culture. It allowed humans to cook food and get warmth and protection. But before that, making fire also allowed destructive use as humans used it to attack predators, insects and each others.\nEveryone knows this story but today I’m going to tell a similar story, as fascinating as this one. It is the story of elliptic curves. I’ll walk you through the pre- big bang and the post- big bang, I’ll show you the biodiversity of elliptic curves species and will present you to the specie used in cryptography, a.k.a. the Homo genus. Finally, we will go through a similar story to fire control that is pairing control.\n I presented this story the 4th of July in Paris during ZK-PAR 0x01, the first Zero Knowledge meetup in the french capital. The meetups started in Tel-Aviv and then London and now Paris. They are intended for anyone interested in applied cryptography for privacy-preserving technology. The presentations are usually focussed on technical and practical aspects of this technology, notably its relation to blockchain technology. You can find more information and community discussions in the Facebook group and the Youtube channel.\nZK-PAR 0x01 hosted two speakers, Bastien Teinturier and myself.

But how can one construct such a polygon?\nIn 1796, a 19 years old Gauss showed how to construct a heptadecagon using only a compass and an unmarked straightedge. The teenage’s proof relies on the property of irreducible polynomial equations and Fermat primes, those of the form $2^{2^n}+1$.\nIf it is only about proving constructibility, the solution is clear. Taking $360°=17φ$, if $\\cos φ$ can be expressed as a square root then the construction is possible as $\\cos φ$ represents the $x$ coordinate of a point on the circumference of a unit circle. There is a computational process to prove that:\n   Given the fact that $S_n=\\cos φ + \\cos 2φ + \\dots + \\cos nφ$ implies that $2S_n \\sin φ/2 = sin((2n+1)φ/2-sin(φ/2)$ (1) (a simple proof uses trigonometric identities), and setting: $cosφ+cos4φ =a, cos2φ+cos8φ =b, cos3φ+cos5φ =c, cos6φ+cos7φ =d$, and $a+b=e$ and $c+d=f$ you can find that $e+f = \\frac{-1}{2}$ ($S_8=\\frac{-1}{2}$ by applying (1)) and that $e.f=-1$ by straightforward trigonometric calculation. This means that $e$ and $f$ are solutions to the quadratic equation $x^2+x/2–1$ according to Vieta’s formulas. Thus $e=\\frac{-1}{4}+\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{16}}$ and $f=\\frac{-1}{4}-\\sqrt{\\frac{17}{16}}$. Now, the equation $x^2−ex - \\frac{1}{4} = 0$ has roots $a$ and $b$ that yield to $a$ and $b$ expressions, and we find $c$ and $d$ the exact same way. Finally, $\\cos φ$ and $cos4φ$ are roots to $x^2− ax + c/2$ because $cos φ · cos 4φ = c/2$. Expressing all those roots yields the expression of $cos(2\\pi /17)$ in terms of square roots of 17.\nAll this calculation is just a confirmation. Gauss uses cyclotomic eqations theory to prove the construction works the way it does. Consider the equation $x^17 -1=0$ and $ζ$ as a 17th primitive root, we have $ζ+…+ζ^{16}+1=0$. Let’s now take a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}_{17}^*$, say 3. Then the roots can be expressed as powers of $ζ^3$. Define $x_1=ζ^{3^0}+ζ^{3^2}+\\dots+ζ^{3^{14}}$ and $x_2=ζ^{3^1}+ζ^{3^3}+\\dots+ζ^{3^{15}}$, then $x_1+x_2=-1$ and $x_1 x_2=-4$. This defines a quadratic for which $x_1$ and $x_2$ are roots. Similarly, define $y_1=ζ^{3^0}+ζ^{3^4}+ζ^{3^8}+ζ^{3^{12}}$ and $y_2=ζ^{3^2}+ζ^{3^6}+ζ^{3^{10}}+ζ^{3^{14}}$ then $y_1+y_2=x_1$ and $y_1 y_2=-1$ defines another quadratic and so on with $y_3=ζ^3 +ζ^5+ζ^{14}+ζ^{12}, y_4=ζ^{10}+ζ^{11}+ζ^7+ζ^6, z_1=ζ+ζ^{16}$ and $z_2=ζ^{13}+ζ^4$.\n   ","date":1565395200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565395200,"objectID":"bb8072f45d269ac62457f30e885bb383","permalink":"/post/heptadecagon/","publishdate":"2019-08-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/heptadecagon/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Heptadecagon","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I this presentation the 4th of July in Paris during ZK-PAR 0x01, the first Zero Knowledge meetup in the french capital.

There have been so far nine sessions that discussed several cryptographic topics. The first four sessions broke down the ZK-STARKs, the fifth session was a deep dive into RSA accumulators, the sixth was about Sigma protocols, the seventh discussed the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and the eighth was about multi-party computations. The sessions are usually recorded and put available online:\n session 1: ZK-STARKs seesion 2: ZK-STARKs session 3: ZK-STARKs session 4: ZK-STARKs session 5: RSA accumulators session 6: Sigma protocols session 7: Fiat-Shamir heuristics session 8: Multi-party computations  The ninth session happened last Monday 6th May and was the first of a series about the recent paper called “Zexe: Enabling Decentralized Private Computation” by Sean Bowe from ZCash, Alessandro Chiesa, Pratyush Mishra and Howard Wu from UC Berkeley, Matthew Green from Johns Hopkins University and Ian Miers from Cornell Tech. I had the chance to lead this session and discuss the paper’s ideas with wonderful community enthusiasts. The video can be found here and the session’s notes here.\nBasically, the aim behind Zexe is to write private smart contract on a distributed ledger. Such a scheme can be constructed by doing offline computation and uploading a proof of correct execution to the ledger. The proof should be zero-knowledge, succinct and easy to verify. To do this, the paper introduces a new cryptographic primitive called decentralized private computation (DPC) and comes up with some efficient implementation tricks that range from zkSNARK optimization, recursive proof composition and a new set of elliptic curves.\nThe starting point of Zexe is to extend Zerocash protocol to more general token-based blockchains. This protocol provides a privacy-preserving version of Bitcoin-like blockchains via the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). To create a coin a user publishes a commitment and to consume it he publishes its unique serial number alongside some ZKP that the serial numbers belong to some old coins and that the commitments preserve the same total value. In Zexe, an integer value coin is a data payload record and the ZKP assures that an arbitrary function was applied to old records to create the new ones. The problem now is, if we want the function to be user-defined, how can we make sure it stays private, and if so, how can we isolate “malicious” functions from “honest” functions? One straightforward solution would be to add a ZKP that proves the same function was used; this basically boils down to using a Zerocash per function (i.e. per token) which results in a functionality limitation as one cannot do private cross-token swaps for instance and moreover the anonymity set would be limited to each each specific token history. Another solution would be to use a universal function on the ledger and embed user-defined functions within the data payload. To do this, we need a minimalist shared execution environment (some sort of an operating system) where different processes can be executed without violating the privacy of each. Zexe calls it records nano-kernel where a record is now: data payload, birth predicate for records creation, death predicate for records consumption, transaction memorandum for public input needed by the predicates and auxiliary input for private input. The problem now is, if the predicates are arbitrary functions, do we need a SNARK per predicate or a universal SNARK? While awesome research is being conducted to propose a universal SNARK like Sonic, efficient implementations are yet to come. A solution to the cost of universality would be to do “a proof of a proof”, that is, generating a proof of the predicate and then generating another proof of the previous proof that will be verified on the ledger. This way, we need a single circuit on the ledger and a circuit per predicate offline.\nWhile empirically proved via cycles of elliptic curves, recursive proofs are not efficient at 128-bit security level. In fact, a SNARK proof (i.e. in Groth16) is a set of points on an elliptic curve that has a subgroup of order $n$ so the generation has arithmetic in $\\mathbb{F}_n$ whereas the verification uses p airing computations where most of the computations are on an extension of the field size $p$. This causes an arithmetic mismatch that results in an overhead of $log(p)$ when one wants to implement naïvely a verification circuit. The solution to this is to use a cycle of elliptic curves where the field size of one is equal to the subgroup order of the other and vice-versa. The only pairing-friendly cycle of elliptic curves we know is the set of MNT4 and MNT6 curves that have a low embedding degree and thus are not quite efficient at 128-bit security level. In Zexe scheme, we need merely a proof of a proof so the authors came up with a chain of elliptic curves rather than a cycle, namely a Cocks-pinch curve embedded over a BLS curves that is highly 2-adic with respect to both the field size and the subgroup order.\nThis is somewhat an overview of Zexe, but the paper includes more contributions such as delegating the generation of a proof to an untrusted worker (delegated DPC), minimizing operations over the (heavy) embedded cocks-pinch curve, optimizing the NP statements à la Zcash and more\u0026hellip;\n","date":1557360000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557360000,"objectID":"6404d562697d7db2197250d5ba20ab71","permalink":"/post/zexe/","publishdate":"2019-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/zexe/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"ZEXE - Zero-knowledge EXEcution","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good…” —Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Chapter 36: The Flaw in the Plan.\n The Horcrux hunt was a mission started by Albus Dumbeldore and given to Harry Potter to find all of Lord Voldemort’s remaining Horcruxes and destroy them. Obsessed with immortality from a young age, Lord Voldemort created a series of Horcruxes in an effort to prevent his death. A Horcrux is a vessel into which one places a piece of one’s soul to protect one from mortal death. Voldemort split his soul into 7 secret parts in a way that reconstruction is possible. It is widely believed that the process for Horcrux splitting involves a spell and a horrific act is performed after a murder has been committed, but this is not true. Voldemort invented this cover story to keep secret the very simple spell he used (a wizard patent for the technical term) — it is called the 3S spell.\nThe 3S spell is nothing but a Shamir secret sharing scheme. In this scheme, a dealer (Voldemort) splits a secret (his soul) into multiple shares (Horcruxes) in a way that reconstruction is only possible when combining all of the shares or some sufficient fixed number of them. The spell uses some basic polynomial algebra magic (1st year at Hogwarts) and some finite field wizardry.\nBasic scheme Let’s $s$ be the secret and $n$ the number of shares, a dealer can construct a secret sharing scheme where only $t \u0026lt; n$ custodians can reconstruct the secret $s$. He first generates a $t$-degree polynomial $P(X) = p_0 + p_1X + p_2X^2 + · · · + p_t X^t$ where $p_0$ is the secret $s$ and $p_1, p_2, \\dots , p_t$ are chosen at random from the finite field we’re working in (e.g. $\\mathbb{F}_31$ which means integers from 0 to 30). He then computes the points $v_1 = P(1), v_2 = P(2), \\dots and v_n = P(n)$ and distributes these $n$ shares to the custodians. Any $t \u0026lt; n$ shares can reconstruct the polynomial $P$ with interpolation (e.g. Lagrange interpolation) and recover the original secret $s = P(0)$. Note that any $t − 1$ shares would interpolate with high probability a false polynomial.\n   One can draw an infinite number of polynomials of degree 2 through 2 points. 3 points are required to define a unique polynomial of degree 2. This image is for illustration purposes only — Shamir’s scheme uses polynomials over a finite field, not re-presentable on a 2-dimensional plane (Wikipedia)      This is a polynomial curve over a finite field — now the order of the polynomial has seemingly little to do with the shape of the graph (Wikipedia)   Verifiable scheme There are two problems with the basic scheme:\n A malicious custodian can submit a false share A malicious dealer can distribute false shares  The first issue can be addressed by adding some fingerprint to the secret. This way, if a malicious custodian submit a false share, the reconstructed secret won’t be correct and the fingerprint lost. One way to do this is by concatenating the secret s with the hash of the last 31 bytes of s, i.e. s ← (s||sha256(s[: −32]). However, identifying the malicious custodian remains impossible in this approach.\nThe solution to the second problem, can both identify a malicious dealer and a malicious custodian in the first scenario. A simple approach would be to publicly publish the hashes of shares but this might be impractical in some use-cases where the number of custodians increases quickly. In fact, each custodian will have a database of auxiliary information that may increases quickly over the time. A better approach was proposed by Feldman and uses homomorphic commitments.\nFeldman’s approach: In this approach, the dealer publishes the commitments of polynomial’s coefficients $p_0= s$ and $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_t$ that are homomorphic with respect to multiplication. Such a commitment is known to be a Pedersen’s commitment. Given a finite field of prime characteristic $p$ and a generator $g$, the dealer publishes $c_0 \\equiv g^s \\pmod p, c_1 \\equiv g^{p_1} \\pmod p, \\dots$ and $c_t \\equiv g^{p_t} \\pmod p$. Given the commitments $c_i$ for $i \\in [0, t]$, the is no way to retrieve the secret $s$ and the coefficients $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_t$ because of the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. A custodian can verify that the share $v_i$ he was given by the dealer wasn’t tampered with thanks to the homomorphic property of Pedersen’s commitments. In fact,\n   This is basically the magic 3S spell that allowed Lord Voldemort to split his soul into 7 horcruxes. The process is rather simple that even Ronald Weasley can perform, but Tom Riddle invented the horrific-act-after-murder story to keep away wizardry newbies from reaching immortality.\nYes, I ruined your childhood memories.

The summit was organized by Anna Rose and Fredrik Harrysson from zero-knowledge podcast, which is made for fellow developers and people looking to educate themselves on the inner workings of the blockchain zero-knowledge tech space. This one-day event focused on zero-knowledge topics, zkSNARK, MPCs, STARKs and blockchain scaling solutions featuring the following speakers:\n Ahivu Levy (StarkWare Industries) discussing scalability with STARKs Harry Roberts (Ethsnarks) sharing the history of high-level programming languages for making zk proofs John \u0026lsquo;Tux\u0026rsquo; Pacific (Nucypher) on fully homomorphic encryption Jordi Baylina (Iden3) on Circom and Snarkjs Izaak Meckler (CODA Protocol) on the secrets of SNARK programming Alex Vlasov (Matter Labs) on scaling \u0026amp; privacy with zkSNARKs in Ethereum Aurélien Nicolas (QED-it, zkproofs.org) discussing zk standards Zachary Williamson (Aztec Protocol) on ERC-1724 confidential digital assets Igor Barinov (POA Network) on scaling with xDai and side chains Jonathan Levi (HACERA) on ZKPs for both permissioned and permissionless blockchains  There were also discussions on confidential transaction scheme based on 1-out-of-N proofs, GDPR and privacy of Zcash shielded transactions as well as deep-dive workshops on practical use and implementation of ZKPs, building a STARK with pen and paper and more. The program ran from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. where talks were presented at two different filmed stages while roundtables and circle discussion happened on two other dedicated rooms. The full program can be found here and the playlist of videos here.\n Since the program was running in parallel, I couldn’t make it to all the presentations so I chose 3 talks and 2 roundtables I was most interested in:\n Talk 1: scalability first with STARK — Ahivu levy (StarkWare industries)     video of the talk   This talk was about scalability using STARKs — It was presented by Ahivu, the head product of StarkWare, a startup that leverages on STARK technology to improve blockchain scalability and privacy. The main takeaway is that they are planning to release their first product mid-april which is a decentralized exchange (DEX) engine on Ethereum. While STARKs can solve privacy on the blockchain as it is widely believed, Ahivu thinks that they are the best candidate to solve scalability thanks to the exponentially small verifier running time.\n Talk 2: fully homomorphic encryption the road to secure computation — John Tux Pacific (NuCypher)     video of the talk   This talk was about secure multiparty computation (SMPC), trusted execution evironments (TEE) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with focus on the latter. It was presented by John who is a cryptography engineer at NuCypher, a startup that works mainly on proxy-reencryption and FHE to build privacy infrastructure for the blockchain. John started by presenting SMPC, TEE and FHE, and and then listed the pros and cons of each approach. Because FHE seems to be the ideal approach, he then exposed how research is aiming to address FHE cons.\n Talk 3: Scaling and privacy with zkSNARKs in Ethereum — Alex Vlasov (Matter Labs)     video of the talk   Although the title of this talk is “scaling and privacy with zkSNARKs in Etherem”, the presentation was mainly about the new zero-knowledge protocol called SONIC and its comparison to the actual Groth16 zkSNARK protocol implemented in ZCash. The talk was presented by Alex who works at Matter Labs, a startup aiming to scale the blockchain using zero-knowledge proofs. SONIC is a new ZK proving system that requires an updatable and universal trusted setup — that means unlike other SNARKs, SONIC does not require a trusted setup for each circuit, but only a single setup for all circuits (up to a given circuit depth) and it never has to end, so it can be continuously secured by accumulating more contributions. To this point, Alex gave a nice comparison between usual SNARKs and SONIC; imagine you are playing a card game and you want some trusted deck of cards, in SNARKs you shuffle the deck and then you pass it to other players who shuffle it again every time you start a new game, but in SONICs you only shuffle the deck once and then “clone” it every time you start a new game (this works for every game that requires the same number of cards or less ~circuit depth). For efficiency comparison, Groth16 is still better (0.6s vs 9s for a single proof and 3s vs 11.5s for a batch of 5 proofs — according to Alex benchmark) but we still need an efficient SONIC implementation as in Bellman to compare apples to apples. The main takeaway is that SONICs are a real breakthrough that solve somewhat the SNARKs trusted setup issue. It is to mention that I discussed SONICs with Ariel Gabizon (former ZCash cryptographer who discovered the trusted setup counterfeiting bug in ZCash) after the talk and he believes that a lot of research is being conducted in this direction and more efficient protocols are likely to be proposed later this year.\n Roundtable 1: GPU implementation of zksnark prover — Konstantin Panarin (Matter Lab)     This roundtable was animated by Konstantin from Matter Labs. He started by describing NVIDIA GPU architecture and code parallelization principles with examples, then he discussed how we can benefit from GPUs to speedup the proving step in Groth16 zkSNARKs. The most important part of the proving step (~60% of the computation time) is the multi-exponentiation and one way to do this efficiently is using Pippenger algorithm (ZCash by the way moved from Bos-Coster algortihm to Pippenger after Sapling activation). We discussed how the algorithm works and how it can be enhanced using NVIDIA GPUs keeping in mind that an enhancement should not only address the computation time but also the memory cost.\n Roundtable 2: Building a STARK with pen and paper — Mathew Stevens and Micro Richter     This one was funny actually— we were 30 people at the beginning but only 10 stayed until the very end because of the heavy maths content. We deep dived into all the dirty details of the mathematical machinery behind zkSTARKS given a toy example (a Fibonacci sequence). The steps are:\n Arithmetic intermediate representation (AIR) to show a computation as an execution trace with algebraic registers and to create polynomial contraints, algebraic placement and routing (APR) to transform the AIR into functions that are Reed-Solomon codes if and only if the execution trace is a witness, Reed-Solomon proximity testing (RPT) to check that an APR witness is an actual Reed-Solomon code in an efficient way, and fast Reed-Solomon Interactive oracle proof of proximity (FRI) to efficiently check the proximity to the Reed-Solomon codes.      The summit was closed by a park bench panel animated by Anna and Fredrik in a game form. Anyone from the audience can ask any question but if it turns out to be an opinion/remark then she/he is invited on stage to answer the upcoming questions. Here is a question I asked (which is actually an opinion according to Mrs Justice Anna): “Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) like zkSNARKs or zkSTARKs are not proofs but arguments because the soundness is only computational and not statistical, so is it a mistake to call them proofs?”\nBesides the talks which were really interesting, this event was an opportunity to meet a lot of people from the broad ZKP/Blockchain community and to discuss technical details with sometimes the authors of some papers I’ve been scouring over the few last months. For this reason, I want to thank the organizers Anna and Fredrik for putting all of this together and especially Xavier De Boissieu and Quentin Drouot from EY for making my attendance possible.\n","date":1553299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553299200,"objectID":"a0d297c6200510b79a624ef44d992c28","permalink":"/post/zk_summit_3/","publishdate":"2019-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/zk_summit_3/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Zero-knowledge summit - ZK0x03","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In my first post, we’ve seen that elliptic curves cryptography (ECC) was first introduced as a better alternative to public-key cryptography based on multiplicative groups of finite fields. In fact, ECC requires smaller keys compared to its finite field analog to provide equivalent security. Finite fields cryptosystems rely on the “hardness” of the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) to build cryptographic tools such as encryption (ElGamal), key exchange (Diffie-Hellman DH) and digital signature algorithms(DSA). Analogously, one expects to have ElGamal, DH and DSA counterparts thanks to the “hardness” of the equivalent elliptic curves discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). However, it seems that only ECDH and ECDSA are popular. So, is there an ElGamal version for elliptic curves? Is direct encryption even possible with elliptic curves?\nThe use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller in 1985. The main reason was that previous asymmetric approaches were subject to subexponential-time index calculus algorithms that solve the underlying hard problems, whereas no subexponential-time algorithms are known for the discrete logarithm problem in a (suitably chosen) elliptic curve. Moreover, for the most part the best available algorithms are ones that have nothing to do with the specific structure of the elliptic curve group, but rather would work with essentially the same running time on any group. Such algorithms are said to be “generic”. In his paper, Koblitz suggested an encryption algorithm similar to ElGamal but it needed an invertible function to map plaintexts to points on an elliptic curve which made the scheme a bit impractical. The algorithm works as follows:\n We set up an elliptic curve $E$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and a point $P$ of order $N$. We need a public known invertible function $f$ that maps messages $m$ to points $P_m$ on $E$. We choose a random secret key $x \\in [1,N-1]$ and publish the point $Y=xP$ as public key. Encryption: We choose a random integer $k \\in [1,N-1]$, then calculate $C_1=kP$, $C_2=kY$ and $P_m=f(m)$. The ciphertext is the tuple $(C_1, C_2+P_m)$. Decryption: From the ciphertext $(C, D)$ we calculate $C'=xC$ and retrieve the point $P_m$ with $P_m=D-C'$ ($=k(xP)+P_m-x(kP)$). Finally, we recover the message $m$ with $f^{-1}(P_m)$.  Basically, this is how we can do encryption on the elliptic curve but for real-world encryption this is somehow impractical because of the required invertible point mapping. One way to do it is interpreting the message as the $X$ coordinate of a curve point and computing a matching $Y$ coordinate. This has two drawbacks:\n First, only about half of the $X$ values can be the first coordinate of a curve point and second, one needs to compute a modular quadratic residue ($Y^2=X^3+aX+b$) to find the $Y$. This is not trivial and requires using Tonelli-Shanks algorithm.  So, for things to work, some variability (some bits which can be adjusted until a possible $X$ is reached) would be needed and since the size of the message would be severely limited (no bigger than $p$) this is hardly worthwhile.\nFor these reasons, direct encryption using elliptic curve is not practical but one can use hybrid encryption instead. That is, using ECDH to produce a shared secret value that will be used as a secret for some symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g. AES). This is called Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES).\n","date":1546473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546473600,"objectID":"bd8250d03349c8d868563d2fb09fcd23","permalink":"/post/encryption_ec/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/encryption_ec/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Encryption using elliptic curves","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What does this title mean?\nWell, last week (October 30th, 2018), Apple published a security update for iOS 12.1 and macOS Mojave 10.14.1 that addresses an issue existing in the method for determining prime numbers. This method was implemented in Apple’s crytptographic library CoreCrypto which is used in many different cryptographic applications. Martin Albrecht, Jake Massimo and Kenny Paterson of Royal Holloway and Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr University were issued the CVE-2018–4398 for discovering the pitfall. The full academic paper can be found here. According to the paper, an attacker may be able to exploit a weakness in the primality test to incorrectly identify prime numbers.\nSo what are prime numbers and why they are used in cryptography? How to efficiently test the primality of a number? and what would be the impact if composite numbers are incorrectly declared primes (Apple primes)?\nPrime numbers A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive integer factors, 1 and itself. For example, if we list the factors of 28, we have 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. That’s six factors. If we list the factors of 29, we only have 1 and 29. That’s two factors. So we say that 29 is a prime number, but 28 isn’t. Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.\nThere are infinitely many primes (Euclid gave a simple proof by contradiction or you can check more recent proofs using Euler product for the Riemann zeta function or the irrationality of $\\pi$ and Leibniz formula) but no known simple formula separates them from composite numbers.\nA deterministic straightforward method to check if an integer $p$ is prime is to test whether $p$ is a multiple of any integer between $2$ and $\\sqrt{p}$, but this method or any deterministic approach remains very slow when dealing with big numbers.\nPrimality tests Many popular primality tests are probabilistic tests because they provide provable bounds on the probability being fooled by a composite number. These tests use, apart from the tested number, some other numbers (witnesses) which are chosen at random; the usual randomized primality tests never report a prime number as composite, but it is possible for a composite number to be reported as prime. The probability of error can be reduced by repeating the test with several independently chosen values of witnesses . The basic structure of randomized primality tests is as follows:\n Randomly pick a number . Check some equality (corresponding to the chosen test) involving and the given number . If the equality fails to hold true, then is a composite number and the test stops. Repeat from step 1 until the required accuracy is achieved. After one or more iterations, if is not found to be a composite number, then it can be declared probably prime.  Fermat Primality Test  Fermat\u0026rsquo;s Little Theorem  If $p$ is as prime number and $a$ is a positive integer less than $p$, then the remainder of $a^{p-1}$ devising by $p$ is $1$ i.e. $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$\n Test Algorithm  If $p$ is the number which we want to test for primality, then we could randomly choose $a$, such that $a \u0026lt; p$ and then calculate $a^{p-1} \\equiv \\pmod p$. If the result is not $1$, then by Fermat’s Little Theorem $p$ cannot be prime. What if that is not the case? We can choose another $a$ and then do the same test again. We could stop after some number of iterations and if the result is always $1$ in each of them, then we can state that is probably prime. The more iterations we do, the higher is the probability that our result is correct.\nMiller-Rabin Primality Test  Key Ideas  Fermat’s Little Theorem. If $p$ is prime and $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$, then $x \\equiv 1$ or $-1 \\pmod p$    The number we want to test its primality is necessarily odd, then $p-1$ is even and we can write $p-1 = 2^s d$ where $d$ is an odd number and $d ≥ 0$.\nIf $p$ is prime, then either $a^d \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ as in this case, repeated squaring from $a^d$ will always yield $1$, so $a^{p-1} \\pmod p$ will be $1$; or $a^{2^r d} \\equiv -1 \\pmod p$ for some $r$ such that $0 \\leq r \\leq s$, as repeated squaring from it will always yield $1$ and finally $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. If none of these hold true, $a^{p-1}$ will not be $1$ for any prime number (otherwise there will be a contradiction with fact #2).\n Test Algorithm  Let be $p$ the given number which we have to test. First we rewrite $p-1$ as $2^s d$. Now we pick some in range and then check whether or for . If both of them fail, then is definitely composite. Otherwise is probably prime. We can choose another and repeat the same test to reduce the probability of error.\n Apple’s pitfall In number theory, a Carmichael number is a composite number $n$ which satisfies the modular arithmetic congruence relation $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ for all integers $a$ which are coprime to $n$, i.e. a composite number that satisfies Fermat’s test. Robert Carmichael found the first and smallest such number, 561, which explains the name \u0026ldquo;Carmichael number\u0026rdquo;. Indeed, $561=3 \\times 11 \\times 17$ and $a^{560} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{561}$ for all $a$ coprime to $561$.\nLike the Fermat, the Rabin-Miller test has Carmichael numbers (choices of $a$ for which the test declares a composite integer to be a probable prime) but there are fewer. It turns out for any composite $n$, including Carmichael numbers, the probability $n$ passes the Miller-Rabin test is at most 1/4 (on average it is significantly less.) Thus the probability $n$ passes several runs decreases exponentially. However, the bases $a$ should be chosen randomly so an attacker wouldn’t be able to find Carmichael numbers with respect to these bases.\nIn corecrypto library, Apple performs $t \u0026lt; 256$ rounds of Miller-Rabin testing, selecting the bases incrementally from a hard-coded list of the first 256 primes. When performing, for instance, $t = 32$ rounds of testing, the probability of a false prime classification is estimated as 1/$2^{64}$. However, since the bases $a$ generation is deterministic, an attacker should be able to find composite numbers that fool the test. This was done in the paper using the method described in Arnault, F \u0026ldquo;Constructing Carmichael numbers which are strong pseudoprimes to several bases\u0026rdquo; paper. An example of such a composite 1024-bit number of the form $n=p \\times q \\times r$ is given below:\nn = 105216055594390884840438324972769319399722594046651360392070071794973423530188471087867855419188813164954561140227145977855514336985746250989366318940490798583710597151720075427387437940535767395296272532149397065590267303873620351321073058502920032770522836726669005262088263964215455869031740912313201227043 with\np = 123282949929736752510916282638002560328626287433241467864741378859343760091491850110380631340085554443 q = 28724927333628663335043493854654596556569924971945262012484741274227096101317601075718687102239934184987 r = 29711190933066557355130824115758617039198935271411193755402672305101846182049535876601732152960618620523 ","date":1541462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541462400,"objectID":"58aff2179b5ff6b9bdf9ecad4d99e9ea","permalink":"/post/apple_primes/","publishdate":"2018-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/apple_primes/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Apple primes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Not to toot my own horn here but when I was in high school I used to be quite popular :). I was moreover one of the least shy people I know but when it came to girls, I was interested in, I suddenly turn to this timid shell of a person. This awkward version of a popular guy is not uncommon and the fear of rejection is the reason that rattles us to the core. I still remember this girl from my high school I’ve never talked to, because of that fear — let’s call her Lalla Salma in the sequel (Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental). No matter how much courage I’ve summoned and how firmly I’ve convinced myself I don’t care about the outcome, hearing no from Lalla Salma would have hurt. A graceful no hurts a great deal less but a cruel no in public drives a knife through the male psyche.\nGrowing up, I became a cryptographer and figured out a mathematical way to deal with such a situation. How can you make secure advances to Lalla Salma ? Is there a way to securely guess the outcome ? or simply put, how can you avoid a dismissive no in public ? The solution uses Yao’s Garbled circuits for secure two-party computation (S2PC).\nGiven private inputs $x$ and $y$ and a public function $f$, this method enables two parties to securely compute the outcome $f(x,y)$ without revealing the secrets $x$ and $y$. A circuit is just a way to represent a computation consisting of just operations on bits, like AND, OR, NOT and a garbled circuit is a way to “encrypt a computation” that reveals only the output of the computation, but reveals nothing about the inputs or any intermediate values. Our situation makes the basic way to understand how the protocol works. Let the secret $x$ be 1 if I am interested in Lalla Salma and 0 otherwise. Similarly, her secret $y$ is either 1 or 0. We want to securely compute a function that outputs 1 if we both are interested in each other and 0 otherwise — no one should be able to guess the inputs. A simple function would be an AND gate.\n   There are 4 possibilities in the truth table but only one is the actual reality. Next, we “garble” this circuit as follows: For each wire $x, y$ and z, we specify two random values corresponding to 0 and 1 and then we encrypt (using some symmetric cipher such as AES) the truth table by encrypting the output-wire key with the corresponding pair of input-wire keys. Which results in the Garbled Computation Table (GCT).\n   Given two input keys only one row of the GCT can be decrypted correctly. Next, we rearrange the GCT — so that no information is leaked — and send it to Lalla Salma along with my input key. Note that, since the key is random, there is no way to associate it with the actual bit. At this point, she has the GCT and my input key but needs the key I have already associated to her input bit. But just like me, Lalla Salma doesn’t want to reveal her secret (bit)! Neither want I to send her both keys, as she would be able to decrypt more than a GCT row. What we need here is a protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to what piece has been transferred. Fortunately, such a protocol exists and is called 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer (OT). In the next section, I will present a simple 1–2 OT protocol but if you don’t know how RSA encryption works just skip this section since explaining it goes beyond the scope of this post.\n1–2 Oblivious Transfer  Alice holds $m_0, m_1$, and an RSA key pair $(e, d, N)$. Bob holds the public key $(e, N)$ of Alice, $x \\in {0,1}$ and wants $m_x$ Alice generates random $x_0, x_1$ and sends them to Bob Bob chooses a random $k$, computes $v=y_x+k^e$ and sends $v$ to Alice. Alice computes $k_0=(v-x_0)^d$ and $k_1=(v-x_1)^d$, and sends $m_0'=m_0+k_0$ and $m_1'=m_1+k_1$ to Bob Bob computes $m_x=m_x'-k$ and learns nothing about $m' _{1-x}$  Now, using 1–2 OT protocol, Lalla Salma can have her input key without me knowing anything about her secret bit. At this point, we can decrypt the GCT row corresponding to our secrets and reveal securely the output value. If it is a 0, none is able to tell who rejected the other and if it is a 1… Jackpot!\nBy and large, this is how we can do secure two-party computation. So, dear Lalla Salma, if by any chance you’re reading my post, here is my secret key ;)\n0x3361736861206c6d616c69696969696b ","date":1540166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540166400,"objectID":"4554f84e94618e99903e23bdeb2c6ce0","permalink":"/post/s2pc/","publishdate":"2018-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/s2pc/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Secure Two-Party Computation (S2PC)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Every name tells a story. If you ask new parents \u0026ldquo;how did you choose your baby’s name?\u0026rdquo; sometimes the response will be a vague \u0026ldquo;Oh she chose!\u0026rdquo; but most of the time there is a story behind, and it’s often a great story about going through dozens of possibilities until one clicked. It goes from her favorite fictional character to her favorite great-aunt, so the baby has to be called Khaleesi. Obviously. In mathematics, it is no different. When mathematicians introduce their new baby to the world, they choose an appropriate name far from being random. In my last post, I have talked about elliptic curves and why they are used in cryptography. This triggered the question on why they are called \u0026ldquo;elliptic\u0026rdquo; even though they do not resemble ellipses in any way.\n   Elliptic curves are of cubic equations $y^2=x^3+ax+b$ while ellipses are of quadratic equations $x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1$. So, prima facie, there is no connection between them. But looking deeply into the history of elliptic curves, one finds out the connection. In the 18th century it was natural to ask about the arc length of an ellipse. In fact, despite their similarity to circles, ellipses are quite different. For example, a circle’s circumference is given by $2 \\pi r$ and its area by $\\pi r^2$ where $r$ is the radius. It is remarkable how the constant $\\pi$ relates the circumference to the area given the radius $r$. But things are not that easy when dealing with ellipses. Given $a$ and $b$ as the semi-radii, the area of an ellipse is $\\pi ab$ but the circumference is a more difficult question. More generally, the arc length of ellipses is difficult to calculate and is given either by a hard integral or by a rather formidable series. This question led to the study of $\\sqrt{f(x)}$ where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4. These functions cannot be described with familiar calculus functions and came to be known as elliptic integrals. For circles, $f(x)$ is a quadratic polynomial and we get \u0026ldquo;circular integrals\u0026rdquo; which are easy to handle. for example, we know that $\\int dx / (\\sqrt{1-x^2}) = \\sin ^{-1} (x)$ and the inverse of the function, namely $\\sin{x}$, is well studied and easy to deal with. Thus, circular integrals lead to the periodic trigonometric functions. Similarly, studying the inverse of elliptic integrals leads to some doubly periodic functions which came to be known as elliptic functions (let’s call them ℘(z) in the sequel, because ℘ looks nice). Furthermore, all the derivatives are doubly periodic with the same periods and satisfy a cubic differential equation. Now in calculus, you learn about parametric equations and how they can describe a curve. By a parameterization of a curve $C$, we mean a continuous bijection from a set of numbers to the set of all points on $C$. For example, letting $x=a \\sin{t}$ and $y=b \\cos{t}$ with $t \\in [0, 2 \\pi)$ gives a familiar parameterization of the standard ellipse $x^2/a^2+y^2/b^2=1$. In the same way, we see that setting $x=℘(z)$ and $y=℘’(z)$ gives a parameterization of the cubic curve known today as an elliptic curve. Names are reservoirs of stories and this was the story behind elliptic curves’ name.\nOne last thing before I forget, dear future son, if this post lives long enough so that you are reading it now, I am sure you will understand why I called you Jon Snow.

For many questions, I couldn’t find easily or completely the answer I was looking for. One of these questions I faced is: Why did we even consider using elliptic curves for cryptography ? The question is \u0026ldquo;Why\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rdquo;. Elliptic curves are mathematical objects from the algebraic geometry and one should be normally surprised when discovering that such objects are used to encrypt data. In fact, elliptic curves are non-singular algebraic curves satisfying an equation of the form $y^3=x^3+ax+b$ (cf. figure 1).\n   Figure 1: Examples of elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{R}^2$   Well, that doesn’t help us a lot.. And since I started this post with a question you have the right to ask more questions: What do these mathy words mean? How did we get this equation? And why are they even called \u0026ldquo;elliptic\u0026rdquo; even though they do not resemble \u0026ldquo;ellipses\u0026rdquo; in any way ? Don’t worry I’ve asked myself these same questions and we’re going to deep dive into the answers in later posts. For now, let’s go back to the main question: Why do we use these curves to encrypt data? To answer this we have to trace the evolution of cryptography over the years. The earliest known cryptographic schemes use a symmetric approach — that is using the same key for both encryption and decryption. A simple example of this approach and one of the oldest would be \u0026ldquo;Caesar cipher\u0026rdquo; in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In this scheme the encryption/decryption key is the fixed number of positions that must be kept secret and known only to the communicating parties. This symmetric approach is still widely used today through many ciphers such as AES, Blowfish or RC4 but the requirement of a secret symmetric key is still the main drawback. Cryptographers have been then looking for innovative asymmetric approaches where the decryption key differs from the encryption one. That is said, they have been looking for algorithms where it is easy to derive the decryption key (public) given the encryption key (private) and difficult the other way around — or mathematically put, a function that is straightforward to compute and computationally hard to inverse. One of the first algorithms proposed and still widely used nowadays is the famous RSA which relies on the hardness of the \u0026ldquo;factorization problem\u0026rdquo;. In fact, given two prime integers, it is easy to compute their multiplication but presumably hard to find the prime integers given the multiplication output. At this point you may (should) be asking why is it hard to factorize an integer and the answer is that there is no published algorithm that can do this in polynomial time (an algorithm is said to be of polynomial time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial expression in the size of the input for the algorithm). In fact, the best published asymptotic running time (on a classical computer, not a quantum one. Wait, quantum?) is for the general number field sieve (GNFS) algorithm which has a sub-exponential complexity. In short, integer factorization is \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo; in the sense of computational efficiency because we haven’t found just yet a reason for it to be easy, and we can’t prove it is hard. All this to come to the point that integer factorization, in my opinion, has nothing to do with the unknown primes distribution as widely believed. It is true that the problem is built upon the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that every integer can be uniquely represented as the product of prime numbers but I think that the chaotic nature of primes distribution has no bearing on the problem. There’s no reason to expect that factorization would become even a bit easier by proving the Goldbach conjecture, the twin primes conjecture or the Riemann Hypothesis for examples. However, the problem becomes computationally easier (polynomial time) when using quantum computers to run Shor’s algorithm as we will see on a later post. Another proposed asymmetric construction relies on the hardness of the \u0026ldquo;discrete logarithm\u0026rdquo; problem in cyclic groups. Given integers a and b in a carefully chosen group G, no efficient method is known for recovering the integer k such that $a=b^k$. In fact, the problem is quickly computable in a few special cases but in some cases there is not only no efficient algorithm known for the worst case, but the average-case complexity can be shown to be about as hard as the worst case using random self-reducibility. So choosing the group G is critical and a popular choice that provides good security assumptions is large prime order subgroups of groups $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. These groups were used to build several known cryptographic protocols such as ElGamal encrytpion, Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). However, using these groups requires large key sizes because of the sub-exponential GNFS algorithm as well. In fact, while computing discrete logarithms and factoring integers are distinct problems, both are special cases of the hidden subgroup problem for finite Abelian groups and thus, for both, the most efficient approach remains GNFS on a classical computer and Shor’s algorithm on a quantum computer. At this point, you may be thinking that somehow changing that group G from finite fields to elliptic curves may provide better security assumptions. You’re right! The best published algorithms to find discrete logarithms over elliptic curves are Pollard’s $\\rho$ or baby-step-giant-step with a way better running time than GNFS. But wait, what is a discrete logarithm over elliptic curves? (you ask a lot of questions, huh?) Well, no worries, we will soon deep dive into all the machinery ;)\n","date":1538870400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538870400,"objectID":"36a4779f351f91c86c19765e9dd3f864","permalink":"/post/why_ec/","publishdate":"2018-10-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/why_ec/","section":"post","summary":"From my Medium blog - medium.com/@youssef.housni21","tags":null,"title":"Why do we use elliptic curves for cryptography?","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jean-Luc Danger","Youssef El Housni","Adrien Facon","Cheikh T.
